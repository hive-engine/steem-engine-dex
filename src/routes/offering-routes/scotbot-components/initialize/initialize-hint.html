            <h2>Initialize ScotBot</h2>
            <p>
                Want to enable SCOT functionality on your Steem Engine token?
                Begin the process here. If you'd like to operate a token that
                can distribute rewards through steem voting then you need
                scotbot.
                <br />
                <br />
                Scotbot is a closed source python voting bot created by Holger80
                and operated by the steem-engine team. In order to run scotbot
                you first have to create a token (100 eng burn), make it
                stakable (1000 eng burn), and then use this form (1000 eng fee).
                Immediately after filling out the settings it is now live,
                including being able to add the tag onto existing posts and
                collect payout immediately.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you're planning on having many services please prepare for it
                by having a minimum of 200 steem power staked on the issuing
                account. Please don't use your personal account for this as
                you'll need to give us keys or posting/active authority to
                @tokendistributor.
                <br />
                <br />
                We highly recommend posting and active authority over key
                sharing. This is step one of the initialization process. We will
                require your active key and a payment of 500 ENG. You will pay
                the other 500 ENG when you first configure the Scotbot. Please
                note: all deposits are final for setting up Scotbot, there are
                no change of mind refunds. This purchase does not include
                Nitrous, which is a separate product.
